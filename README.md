# **Advanced Sentiment Analysis Project**

This project implements an advanced sentiment analysis system using sequential models (such as RNN, LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional). By leveraging deep learning techniques, it accurately classifies the sentiment of text data into categories like positive, negative, or neutral. This model is designed for handling complex patterns and long-term dependencies in textual data.

## Dataset

- Dataset Used: I have considered the IMDB sentiment dataset.

## Workflow

1. Data Ingestion: Loading data and converting it into training and testing data.
2. Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, cleaning, and text vectorization using embeddings.
3. Model Building: Sequential models like LSTM/GRU are trained on the dataset.
4. Evaluation: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated.
5. Prediction-pipeline: converts the user given text into output.

## Use Cases

- Customer Feedback Analysis: Understand sentiment from product reviews.
- Social Media Insights: Analyze emotions and trends on platforms like Twitter.
- Market Sentiment: Track public opinion for stock market predictions or brand perception.
